● The study utilized various methods to identify and classify cyberbullying tweets, including data
pre-processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms.
● Data pre-processing: Pre-processing aims to transform data for better analysis by removing
unnecessary information, such as special characters and links, in order to generate a cleaner
dataset.
● Feature extraction: We used TF-IDF in our cyberbullying project to extract features from tweet
text.
● Machine Learning Algorithms: We used several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Multilayer perceptrons for tweet
classification.
