For this assignment I used google colab notebook and followed following steps to accomplish the task. 
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Upload Keys.json file to the virtual machine where all the tweeter api keys were saved.
3. Check connectivity with tweeter by using the  keys.
4. Write function to scrape tweeter data and store relevant information into a dataframe
5. Call the scrapping function for a specific query and ask for 5000 tweets. From these tweets, remove all retweets
and tweets less than 5 words.
6. Collect 300 samples randomly
7. Save both data to json files.
